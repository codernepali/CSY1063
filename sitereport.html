            <p>This report outlines my experience in developing this portfolio website, including the learning process, design decisions, and technical implementation.</p>

            <h3>Development Experience</h3>
            <div class="report-content">
                <p>My journey in web development began with this portfolio project. As a beginner, I faced numerous challenges but also gained valuable insights into the world of web development. The process of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch was both challenging and rewarding.</p>
                
                <p>During the development of this website, I experienced several ups and downs. Initially, I struggled with understanding the CSS box model and how to position elements correctly on the page. After numerous trials and errors, I finally grasped these concepts, which significantly improved my layout designs.</p>
                
                <p>One of the most challenging aspects was implementing responsive design. Ensuring that the website looks good on various screen sizes required careful planning and testing. I found the mobile-first approach particularly helpful, as it forced me to focus on the essential content first before adding complexity for larger screens.</p>
                
                <p>Debugging was another area where I learned a lot. Finding and fixing issues in my code taught me patience and attention to detail. I discovered the importance of using browser developer tools to inspect elements and troubleshoot CSS problems.</p>

            <h3>Reflective Discussion of Module Experience</h3>
            <div class="report-content">
                <p>The web development module has been a transformative experience for me. Before starting this course, I had minimal knowledge of how websites work. Now, I can confidently create responsive, well-structured web pages from scratch.</p>
                
                <p>The learning curve was steep, especially when it came to understanding CSS grid and flexbox. However, the hands-on approach of this module allowed me to experiment and learn through practice. This practical experience has been invaluable in cementing my understanding of web development principles.</p>
                
                <p>Working on this portfolio project has given me a practical understanding of the entire web development process, from initial planning and wireframing to implementation and testing. I've learned that good websites require not just technical skills but also an eye for design and user experience.</p>
                
                <p>I'm particularly proud of how I've improved in writing clean, semantic HTML code. I now understand the importance of using appropriate tags not just for styling purposes but also for accessibility and SEO.</p>

        <section class="report-section" id="design-decisions">
            <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
            <div class="report-content">
                <p>For the design of this portfolio website, I aimed for a clean, modern look that would showcase my work effectively while being easy to navigate. I wanted the design to reflect my personality while maintaining professionalism.</p>
                
                <h4>Color Scheme</h4>
                <p>I chose a color palette consisting of dark blue, light gray, and white as the primary colors, with accent colors of teal and orange for highlights. This color scheme creates a professional appearance while still being visually interesting. The contrast between dark and light colors also ensures good readability.</p>
                
                <h4>Typography</h4>
                <p>For typography, I selected 'Roboto' for headings and 'Open Sans' for body text. These sans-serif fonts provide a clean, modern look that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The font sizes are responsive, ensuring that text remains readable on all screen sizes.</p>
                
                <h4>Layout</h4>
                <p>I implemented a grid-based layout throughout the site, which allowed for flexible positioning of elements. For the projects page, I used a different grid layout to showcase the variety of my work in an organized manner.</p>
                
                <p>The websites that influenced my design include:</p>
                <ul>
